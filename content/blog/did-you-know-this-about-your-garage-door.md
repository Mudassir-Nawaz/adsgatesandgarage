Regular upkeep can extend the life of your door and improve its safety
status. Here are 8 tips to keep your garage door functioning as it
should.

1.  Garage Doors Should Have a Monthly Inspection. Don't worry, this is
    something you can do on your own! Each month, you should check the
    spring tension, test the photo eye sensors and safety reverse
    mechanism, check the door balance, and inspect the weatherstripping
    at the bottom of your door.

2.  Clean the Garage Door Tracks

Over time, your garage door's tracks can accumulate debris, which can
slow down the door operation and make it difficult for the door's
rollers to move. To keep your garage door functioning at optimal speed,
you should clean the door's tracks every two to three months. Here's how
to do it quickly and easily:

● Open your garage door to access the lower, vertical part of each
track.

● Dampen a soft, lint-free cloth with water or a gentle household
cleaner and wipe it along the interior of the lower part of the track.
For difficult-to-remove debris, spray cleaner directly on the track and
allow it to sit for several minutes before wiping the area with a
lint-free cloth.

● Close your garage door to access the upper, horizontal part of each
track.

● To clean the upper portion of each track, repeat the same thing you
did with the lower part of the tracks.

3.  Lubricate All Moving Parts

Bi-yearly lubrication is very important when you're maintaining your
garage door, as well as after cleaning the tracks. WD-40 is a good
product to use. This will maximize efficiency and minimize noise and
mechanical failures.

4.  Test the Auto-Reverse Feature

Your garage door's auto-reverse feature is perhaps its most critical
safety mechanism, which means it's essential that you test its
functionality once a month. The auto-reverse feature forces the door to
reverse upward when it encounters an object in its path, which means it
can potentially save a life---but only when it's fully functional.
Here's how to test it:

● Open the garage door fully and place an object on the floor of your
garage, directly in the closing path of the garage door. Be sure the
object does not interrupt the photo-eye sensors' beam, or the door will
refuse to close. We recommend using an object of approximately 1 ½
inches in height.

● Activate the garage door so that it begins to close.

● When the garage door touches the solid object in its path, it should
reverse upward within 2 seconds. If it fails to reverse, it's time to
contact [ADS Garage Door and Gates](/contact/) to repair the opener.

5.  Test the Photo-Eye Sensors

Your garage door's photo-eye sensors are a critical component of its
auto-reverse feature, so you must also test the sensors once per month.
After you've performed the auto-reverse test, here's how to check the
sensors' functionality:

● Open the garage door fully. Place a large object on the floor of your
garage in the closing path of the garage door.

● Activate the door using the automatic opener.

● The door should immediately refuse to close when the photo-eye sensors
detect the object's presence. If the door continues to close, you'll
need to contact [ADS Garage Door and Gates](/contact/) to examine the sensors and
replace them, if necessary.

6.  Inspect Rollers

A visual inspection of your rollers is a simple way to determine the
overall health of your garage door when using a garage door maintenance
checklist. Look at the wheels -- are they worn or damaged? Is the track
straight and stiff? Is it sagging or damaged? Roller wheels get a lot of
wear -- they should be replaced about every seven years and inspected at
least twice a year by [ADS Garage Door and Gates](/contact/).

If your rollers or your roller track are in bad shape, it can lead to
poor performance, or even failure of your garage door, so call ADS
Garage Door and Gates to replace them if you see damage or poor
performance.

7.  Balance Test

You can test the balance of your garage door by closing the door and
disconnecting the automatic opener mechanism.

Stand either inside or outside the door and raise it manually. It should
be easy to raise and lower, with a smooth action that offers little
resistance. It should also stay in place when fully open -- even without
the automatic mechanism.

If you can't open your door easily or it falls down after it's been
manually raised, it is out of balance -- and a trained technician from
[ADS Garage Door and Gates](/contact/) should re-adjust it for you. This is a very
important function of your garage door because if you can't open your
door without power, you could be in for some trouble if you ever have an
outage or can't use your automatic opener.

8.  Garage Doors Should Be Tuned Up Twice a Year.

your garage door is working correctly.
